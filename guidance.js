The GSA.gov linking policy presents the policy, disclaimers, and link notifications of GSA.gov, and can serve as a model for all GSA websites.</p><p>Do not duplicate information maintained elsewhere; link to the source.</p><p>Sometimes, this means linking to related non-federal websites. If you link to non-federal sites, remind visitors that those websites do not necessarily operate under the same laws, regulations, and policies as federal websites by clearly identifying 'non-government' links.</p><p>Consider the following, when developing criteria for, or linking to, external sites:</p><ul><li>Is the link appropriate? Is the content mission-related? Is there a conflict of interest?</li><li>What value does it add for GSA’s customers?</li><li>Could a link to a commercial site give the appearance of favoritism or bias? If more than one commercial site offers similar products, information, or services, then you must either link to all sites, or none. You may link to commercial third-party websites if GSA has a formal relationship with the organization or business that operates the website, to increase awareness of the GSA activity. GSA must treat all business partners equally.</li><li>Does a site pose potential privacy issues because they collect PII?</li><li>Would it be easy for your team to monitor and validate the linked information on a regular basis, to ensure it remains relevant for GSA customers?</li><li>Have you consulted with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to research and resolve any potential copyright issues (i.e., a news site with an article about a GSA program)?
